Scripts necessary to run analysis for manakin cross-river gene flow manuscript in progress

First, run the raw_to_VCF code [[note: need to change the directory names]] to combine reads from sequencing runs, align to the vitellinus reference, and call genotypes with Stacks. Next, run the filtering script [[note: need to change the directory names]] to produce two files: one for use with dadi and another for the rest of the popgen analyses. Those two files are provided here, so the first steps can be skipped.
